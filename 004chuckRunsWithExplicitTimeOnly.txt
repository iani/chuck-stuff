// connect SinOsc to dac
SinOsc s => dac;

440 => s.freq;

// advance time; allow audio to compute
1::second => now;

/*
NOTE: ChucK will exit after 1::second has reached now. 

Thus, it only "lives" as long as there is some explicit duration chucked to now, and that time has not yet past.

Note 2: In this sense, a ChucK program is equivalent to a Routine in SuperCollider.  The difference is that inside a ChucK program one can put "raw" UGen statements, (SuperCollider does not do that. It spawns processes in a different program, the server.)
